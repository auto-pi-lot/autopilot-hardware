# autopilot-hardware
hardware designs for autopilot :)

Everything in this repository is documented at the [autopilot wiki](https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com) - https://wiki.auto-pi-lot.com - and that is intended to be the primary way to browse these designs! As such you won't find much in the way of "text," BOMs, etc. here, but I will try to keep a reference to the relevant wiki pages in the relevant README.md files in the subfolders.

These are Jonny's ongoing hardware designs for use with [autopilot](https://github.com/wehr-lab/autopilot). Issues and Pull Requests are welcome, but since the wiki allows you to link to the specific repository where a part is held, it might be a better idea to make separate repositories indexed by the wiki rather than trying to pull designs into this one.
